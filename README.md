# Dudo Game

## Introduction
I've been slowly working towards implementing a Dudo (Liar's Dice) game from scratch. If you don't know what it is it's basically a bluffing game with dice. You might have played it as a minigame in the original Red Dead Redemption!

My goal is to improve in Rust which I've been really into lately. It's also a chance to build a fun game I can play with friends. I'm additionally using this as a chance to learn about game design architectures and in this case I adopted the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. It's definitely overkill for a simple game like this but I do have plans to scale it and add blockchain/crypto features (still trying to figure out a way that actually improves gameplay rather than throwing in crypto blindely so still TBD).

I'll be supplementing this with a blog series on substack about things I learned and the beauty of the Rust language!
